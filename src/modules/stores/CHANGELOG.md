# Changelog — the store

**This service's own log. One entry per working session on this service,
newest first.** Use the entry shape in the root `CHANGELOG.md` ("How to write
an entry"): Asked for · Shipped · Found · Proved · Left open · Commits — and
its three rules: numbers you ran, not numbers you remember; a guard is not
proved until it has refused something; "Left open" is the handover.

Work that touches the core or several services still goes in the root
`CHANGELOG.md`.

## 2026-09-15 · moved into its own folder

**Asked for:** the owner's request of 15 September — the code split into one
folder per hotel service, so one agent can be given one service and several
can work at once (`docs/SERVICE-FOLDERS-PLAN.md`). For this folder: its brief.

**Shipped**
- Step 3 (`e9dd6b1`): `nav.ts` — the Store entry, in the housekeeping and
  store roles' menus; `routes.tsx`; `index.ts`; a first `MODULE.md`; and
  `api/src/modules/stores/index.ts`, which mounts `stores.ts`.
- Step 4 (`cddb5f4`): moved in — `pages/Stores.tsx` (from `src/pages/`) and
  `data/stores.ts` (from `src/data/repositories/`). Nothing else used them.
- `e754c49`: `data/stores.ts` takes the business date from the core.
- This brief: `MODULE.md` rewritten from the code — one screen, 6 endpoints,
  two tables, the rules; this file; `MEMORY.md` indexing four root entries.

**Found** (while writing the brief; nothing numbered)
- No file in `api/test/` touches the store's routes.
- The Store screen never sends the outlet an issue went to, though the column
  and the API take one.

**Proved** — run in this worktree on 15 September, on the commit that adds
this file
- `npx tsc -b`: clean.
- `npx vitest run src/test/boundaries.test.ts`: 4 passed. With
  `src/modules/crs/MODULE.md` taken away it failed naming that file; put back,
  it passed.
- `npx vitest run`: 204 passed in 15 files, with placeholder
  `VITE_FIREBASE_*` values supplied. Without them 31 tests in
  `src/App.test.tsx` fail here — this worktree has no `.env` (gitignored) —
  and the same 31 failed with the brief-only folders taken out. Every run also
  reports 2 unhandled rejections from `src/lib/outbox.ts` under jsdom.
- Every line under "Before the move" below, and in `MEMORY.md`, was matched
  against the root files' headings by a script: all exact.
- Not run for this entry: the server's gates and `db/tests/run.sh` — nothing
  here touches the server or the database.

**Left open**
- The server code is still in `api/src/routes/stores.ts`; moving it into
  `api/src/modules/stores/` is step 5, in progress elsewhere.
- `db/tests/modules/stores.sql` does not exist yet.
- Purchase and expense approvals — the owner's decision (PENDING § 4).

**Commits:** `e9dd6b1` · `cddb5f4` · `e754c49`, and the commit that added
this file.

## Before the move — entries in the root CHANGELOG.md

- 2026-09-15 (step 3) · A menu for each person, and the search it depends on

Before 8 September the root file has no entries: `git log` and
`PROGRESS.md` (stage 18, "The store, and a way through") are the record.
